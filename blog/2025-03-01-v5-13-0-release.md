# Release Notes

### ‚ú® New Features

- Battle Pass
  - As we wrap up Season 2, we want to also be more transparent about when seasons will end and the rewards.

  - Season 2 will be ending end of March

- New Quests!
  - Added new Daily Craft quest
  - Added new Daily Boss Fights quest
  - Completed Quests will now have a completed icon 
  
- Leaderboard will now display older season rankings as well

- Added Artifact conversions for the wood set (old equipment)
  - See here: [Artifact Conversion](/docs/game-mechanics/artifacts/conversion)

### üé® Improvements
- GOLD pool balancing
  - To improve GOLD pool stability, we have increased the GOLD pool generation rate from 0.00000003 GOLD per second to 0.00000015 GOLD per second. 
  - We have also updated the pool claim logic to balance this out to have gold rewards stay relatively the same. 
  - In the long term, this will allow for less drastic fluctuations within a day and keep GOLD rewards healthy.
- Optimize retrieving unstaked inventory data.
- Optimize Event Handling
- Refactor and removed old code

### üêõ Bug fixes
