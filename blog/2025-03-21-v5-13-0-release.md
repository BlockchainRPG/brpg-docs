### 🎨 Improvements

- GOLD pool balancing
  - To improve GOLD pool stability, we have increased the GOLD pool generation rate from 0.00000003 GOLD per second to 0.00000010 GOLD per second.
  - We have also updated the pool claim logic to balance this out to have gold rewards stay relatively the same.
  - In the long term, this will allow for less drastic fluctuations within a day and keep GOLD rewards healthy.
