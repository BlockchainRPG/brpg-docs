# V5.22.0 Release Notes

This update introduces scalable hunt difficulty, support for multi-character hunts, and a new option for private boss summons, alongside several backend and reliability improvements.

---

## ✨ New Features

### Hunt Difficulty & Multi-Character Hunts

- Hunts now support a **difficulty setting from 1–5**.
- Higher difficulty means:
  - More monsters fought
  - More loot earned
  - Longer cooldown per character
  - **Note: If your character dies during the hunt, you will not get loot!**

**Difficulty breakdown:**

- **Difficulty 1 (Normal Hunt)**
  - 1 mob
  - 1 loot drop
  - 5-minute cooldown
- **Difficulty 5**
  - 5 mobs
  - 5 loot drops
  - 25-minute cooldown

## 🎨 Improvements

### API & Backend

- **Hedged Network Requests**  
  - Implemented **hedged requests** for AtomicAssets and ContractService.  
  - Requests now fan out to multiple endpoints and return the **first successful response**, improving reliability and reducing latency.

- **Build Optimization**  
  - **Source map generation has been disabled** in development, local, and production builds.  
  - This can lead to **smaller deployment sizes** and **potentially faster builds**.

### Code & Data Model Cleanup

- **Item Data Type Refinement**
  - Introduced a `BaseItemData` class and now explicitly cast to `ItemData` where specific item properties are required.
  - This is a step toward a more **generalized and maintainable item data hierarchy**.

- **PlayFab SDK Update**
  - Updated to the latest **PlayFab SDK**, which includes:
    - Changes to authentication contexts (BattleNet, Google Play Games, ServerCustomId).
    - Minor adjustments to **Economy** and **Multiplayer** models.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Various minor fixes and stability improvements related to hunts, networking, and data handling.
- Fixed cooldowns not updating after a hunt.
