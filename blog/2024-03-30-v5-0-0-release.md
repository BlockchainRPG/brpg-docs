## Artifact System Release

We will be releasing the new Artifact system. At the moment, Players will be able to continue using the current equipment system OR switch to the new Artifact system. This switch will be mandatory in a future update.

Artifacts will be upgradable and obtainable through crafting and hunting. To read more about artifacts please see here: [https://blockchainrpg.io/docs/game-mechanics/artifacts]()

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about this update.

Thanks for tuning in and happy hunting!
