# Release Notes

### ‚ú® New Features

- Switched Captcha system from Google Recaptcha to Cloudflare Turnstile
  - A lot of users were getting API Error: Verfication Failed! issues. This should help.
  - This also means we move away from Google services for Cloudflares privacy based approach
  - This also removes a lot of bloat from our codebase since Turnstile is more minimal
  - Also removes annoying Recaptcha bubble at the bottom of the screen :D
