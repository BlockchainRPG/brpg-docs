# Getting Started

Starting a new game can be very intimidating so we want to make sure you have all the information you need to get up and running with as little hassle as possible

## Prerequisites

### WAX Wallet

To play BlockchainRPG, you will need a WAX wallet to interact with the smart contracts.
The simplest way to setup a wallet is by creating an account with WAX Cloud Wallet.
Luckily, we have a guide on creating a WAX Cloud Wallet here:
[How To Create a WAX Cloud Wallet](/docs/resources/wax-blockchain/wallet-creation)

**Note:** If you are new to the WAX blockchain (or need a refresher), here are some good resources to check out:
[What is the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and WAX?](/docs/resources/wax-blockchain/what-is-wax)

### Character NFT

In efforts to reduce bots, support the dev team, and to provide continuous updates to the game, we have enabled a Character Card requirement. Each player must have a Character NFT staked and recruited in order to play the game.

Players may purchase a Character NFT Pack from our [Official BlockchainRPG Shop](https://shop.blockchainrpg.io/) or from the secondary markets.

## The First Hunt

Congratulations! You are now ready to go on your first hunt!

Lets perform a hunt in the Swamplands
You can do so by following the steps listed here:
[How to start a Hunt](/docs/game-mechanics/hunting)

**Note:** Each hunting area has different creatures that you may encounter. The creatures in the Swamplands are perfect for beginners. We recommend that you keep hunting until you craft/acquire/purchase better equipment for your character.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the basics down, the rest of the journey will be up to you!

BlockchainRPG has many [Game Mechanics](/docs/category/game-mechanics/) that you can try out in order to level up your character and become stronger.

## Closing Remarks

Thank you for trying out our game! We are still very much in beta so there may be lots of changes and room for improvement. We would love to hear your feedback in order to provide the best player experience and evolve the game.

Please reach out to us on social media if you have any questions or concerns. We would love to hear from you. Happy hunting!
