# GOLD Tokenomics

GOLD is the core currency for the BlockchainRPG in-game economy. Players can use GOLD for numerous reasons, including purchasing items from the shop, crafting their gear/items, and more!

# Emission

GOLD is generated at a constant rate of 0.00000003 GOLD per second.
This GOLD generated is stored in a GOLD "pool" and used for Hunt rewards.

Hunting in an area will result in a random portion of this GOLD pool x difficulty.

i.e. A hunt in the Forest (Difficulty 2) will result in twice as much GOLD versus a hunt in the Swamplands (Difficulty 1).
