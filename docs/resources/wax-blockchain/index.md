# WAX Blockchain

BlockchainRPG runs on the Worldwide Asset eXchange (WAX) blockchain. According to CoinMarketCap, WAX is a purpose-built blockchain, released in 2017, that is designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, simpler and safer for every party involved. The WAX blockchain uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism.

## Why WAX?

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs within the blockchain that execute when specific requirements are reached without much if any, time delay. They work by following an “if/when…then” logic that is written into code on the WAX blockchain. After verification of specific actions or predetermined conditions, a transaction will go through that is only between the parties involved, which is typically BlockchainRPG and the adventurer. For the purposes of security, speed, and transparency, all transactions with adventurers will involve the use of a smart contract. For example, smart contracts are utilized when receiving items or GOLD upon a successful hunt or crafting a new item. These transactions are visible on your WAX account at the following link:
