# What is the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and WAX?

## What is Blockchain Technology?

A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format (according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)). There are plenty of resources available for curious learners or avid investors, but one of the better ones to learn about blockchain technology is published by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain) that will help give you a great overview on how the technology functions.

## What is Cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset that is designed to function as a medium of exchange through an online network that is not reliant on any centralized authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.

Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger, which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) has a great article written on what cryptocurrency is and how it related to the blockchain technology.

## What is WAX?

BlockchainRPG runs on the Worldwide Asset eXchange (WAX) blockchain. According to CoinMarketCap, WAX is a purpose-built blockchain, released in 2017, that is designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, simpler and safer for every party involved. The WAX blockchain uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism.
