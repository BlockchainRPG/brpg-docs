# Holiday Event 2022

## Greetings Adventurers!

I hope you all are having a wonderful holiday season. We are very excited to announce a special holiday event. During this event, there will be opportunities to craft a limited number of [Holiday Present 2022](../packs/holiday-present-2022). These are NFT packs that contain an exclusive holiday sticker NFT. These stickers are fun collectibles and will allow discord users to use the corresponding emoji on our discord server.

## Goals

### Engage the community

With this event, we hope to engage with the community more since there hasn't been public updates in a while. Rest assured, we are working on some major updates in the background, but these updates will require massive changes to the gameplay, smart contract, and front end which may take some time to release.

### Stimulate the economy

We recognize that there are a lot of end game users that have too many resources and not enough ways to use them. We hope that this event will help stimulate the economy by providing more uses for brpg's tokens in a fun way.

## Specifications

**UI:** During this event, Holiday Treants, music, and snow will be added back to the game.
**Duration:** This event will run from 12/2X/2022 to the end of January 31st, 2023.
**Limit:** There will be a limit of 1000 Holiday Present (2022) minted.
