# Healing

There will eventually come a time when an adventurer will need to heal in order to avoid dying during the next hunt. You can heal either by consuming a HP Regeneration consumable item (ex. HPPOT) or using the free heal mechanic available for all adventurers.

## How to Heal

You may heal a character by going to the Characters Screen, Selecting the character you wish to heal and then clicking the red heart next to their healthbar.
