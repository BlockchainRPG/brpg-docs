# Fusion

The fusion system is a way to combine lower rarity Artifacts into a higher rarity Artifact.

## Specifications

To perform a Fusion, a player must first have 5 Artifacts of the same rarity in their STAKED inventory. In the **Fusion** screen, a player can select the Artifacts they wish to Fuse and click on the Fuse button. Once the player signs the transaction, the Artifacts selected and fusion fee will be burned and the player will be rewarded a new Artifact of the next highest rarity. The new Artifact will have randomly selected attributes from the possible Artifacts used. Legendary Artifacts can not be selected for Fusion since there is no higher rarity tier above Legendary.
