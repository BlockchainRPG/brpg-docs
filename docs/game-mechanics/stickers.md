# Stickers

Stickers are collectable NFTs that players can acquire/trade/sell

# Uses

Currently, stickers provide no in game benefits. Each sticker will allow discord users to use the corresponding emoji in the Discord server. However, the stickers must be in the player's UNSTAKED inventory so that honeycomb can detect and give the appropriate emoji role. If a user is unable to use the sticker after receiving the role, then the player may need to restart their discord app.
