# Characters

Characters are the primary way for users to play the game. Characters must be recruited in order to unlock other features such as hunting, healing, and equiping. Each Character has their own attributes which may influence how you can play the game. Characters may be purchased or opened from a Pack. They are NFTs that must be staked to be used in game.
