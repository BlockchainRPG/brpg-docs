# Referral System

The Referral System incentivises players to share the game with their friends and peers. Player can share their referral link and when a user signs up using the link, the new user will be set as a referral to the existing player. Referrers will be able to earn a reward when the new player purchases a pack drop. (Conditions apply. See below)

## Pre-Existing Referrals

If you were referred by someone before this system was implemented or if you did not sign up with a referral link, you may still set a referrer to allow them to recieve future rewards.

We do not offer rewards for purchases made by referrals prior to this change. Referral Rewards are for future purchases only.

## Rewards

When a referral purchases an eligible pack drop directly, the referrer will recieve 10% of the sale price as a reward.

### Conditions

In order to prevent abuse and spam, the Referrer must have an account registered and must have a Character card staked in order to reccieve the reward.

This is to ensure that referrers are active and assist their referrals instead of just spamming their invite everywhere.

Players are not allowed to set their referrer to themselves.

Currently only the Starter Pack is eligible for referral rewards.
