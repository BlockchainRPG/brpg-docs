# Blending

When adventurers find duplicate rewards they have a few choices on what to do with the items. They can choose to gift it to a friend, sell it on the open market, or blend it towards a rarer and stronger item on third-party website, NeftyBlocks.

:::caution Note
Please be aware that we are moving away from blends and there will be limited support in issues.
