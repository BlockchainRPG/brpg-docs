# Bosses

Bosses are unique powerful monsters that players can fight for greater rewards, but be careful as they are extremely deadly.

Characters that die whilst fighting a boss will only suffer a max death penalty of 5 minutes.

Each boss will have a rarity (Currently only Common) which will dictate the strength and rewards of the boss.

Bosses are currently a new feature and will be manually spawned in. In the future we will allow them to be summoned using items.

## Drops

Bosses will have two different loot tables. Each with their own rewards.

### Regular Loot Table

The regular loot table will include common rewards with a chance to hit a special loot table

Every 1% of the max health of a boss will give the user a random drop from the Regular loot table.

### Special Loot Table

Special Loot Table is considered the rare drop for a boss. A roll in the Special loot table is guaranteed to be an Artifact.

The player who performs a "Last Hit" on the boss will receive a Special Roll.
