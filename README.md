## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

## Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Contributing

Thank you for your contributions! As we only have one developer and our team is small, we need help wherever possible.

Since we are in beta, we will make updates quite frequently and that can put our documentation out of sync. If you notice a discrepancy please feel free to create an Issue or a Pull Request to fix them :)

Deployments will happen automatically with cloudflare. If a deployment fails, please try Building locally to see if there are any issues.
